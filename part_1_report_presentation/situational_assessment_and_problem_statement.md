*~~very~~ rushed piece, you have my apologies, fengfeng, if you don't have enough time to process it after thursday*

~~*more data showing people concerns about their health wanted.*~~ done!

*"1." means this paragraph is corresponding to specification point 1*

1.Health is a very basic topic that concerns everyone. Keywords like "maintaining healthy", "keep fitness" or "making diet" can strike billions of entries showing how much people care about these issues. Seemingly, there are a huge amount of websites and information behind these entries, but how useful or helpful are they for a person who wishes to *generally* maintain his/her health on a fairly good level?

1.Web applications that focus on health-related topics can be summarized into three typical types. Firstly, there are websites dedicated to serious fitness (e.g. <http://www.muscleandfitness.com/>). These websites may not be suitable for the population who wishes to just generally keep healthy, such as to eat proper diet and do general exercise after work. There are also websites that provide information about nutrition or keeping general health (e.g.<http://www.healthywomen.org/>), and websites which consist of majorly a forum for general ideas exchange (e.g. <https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/66048/health> which is in commitment stage, there are also one for fitness in beta). However, these single purpose websites have very limited knowledge about the user; hardly any provided personal or private health-tracking and assisting services, which obstructed further and costomized discussion/planning for the group of people seeking keeping "easy" healthy.

2.These problems are actually not unique to health-related websites. Generally, "hardcore" topics like fitness could attract more views because finding someone interested in the same topic could be difficult in the real world. Also, building limited-purpose websites are always easier and will take less responsibility.

3.But these problems are worth solving, as the topic of general health has actually been proven important. People inevitably do several light exercises such as walking, climbing stairs etc., and they have to have nutrition intake via eating. These basic things however can play important role in people's general health. In fact, statistics by Australian Bureau of Statistics show that people care about them - over 2.3 million (under-estimated figure) Australians were on a diet in 2011-12 (<http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4364.0.55.007main+features12011-12>), 14% of the population participate in gymnasiums, 23% walk for exercise (<http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Products/4156.0.55.001~Nov+2011~Main+Features~Physical+Recreation?OpenDocument>). There are also many trended applications (<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep>, Apple HealthKit)/smart-devices (<http://www.amazon.com/giftsbox-Original-Bracelet-Waterproof-Wristband/dp/B00PW8IBSS>) that gather information about people's heart rate, pace, walking distance or even sleeping status to monitor the users' conditions about general exercise/fitness. These information may then be analysed by the associated local applications, however, generally, suggestions are hardly given because of the limited functionality. Also, there are very limited online-discussing features exist in these applications.

4.*(I died for writing about the stakeholders, sorry you might want to make significant change to this paragraph)* 
Currently, the people that aims to generally keep fit have little engagement to these websites. That in turn means those general information provider/forum attracted a little portion of their targeted users. Interestingly, people keep seeking for high quality health-related websites: [Is there a Q&A website like Stack Overflow for health?](<https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-Q-A-website-like-Stack-Overflow-for-health>). 

5.By building an web application that aims to be general health oriented, the majority of people can finally have a place to store and share their health data easily, and can be given suggestions by the website assisting system or by professionals/other people keen on keeping health via forum. The benefit of such web application can potentially extend from users to operators, as several commercial services can therefore be bonded into the website. For instance, gymnasiums might want to have their name put on the very top of the list when people decided to attend one near their places, or supermarkets may want to provide up-to-date prices for their wholesome food in the auto-completed weekly diet. Cooperations with smart devices that gather relevant information - smartphones, smart bracelets, smart watches, etc. can become the convenient data source for the web application, which may in turn promote their selling figure. This can be a triple-win situation: user are happy because they got a good assistant taking charge of their health, whilst relevant companies and the website developers could draw profit from providing the service.
