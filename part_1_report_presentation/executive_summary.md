After the several deep and meaningful brainstorms our team come up a great idea of building a website named ‘Health Overflow’ which is centered by a ‘health forum’ and ‘online health manager’. 

The health forum is an integration of stack overflow liked Q&A forum and a re-invention of traditional idea exchanging forum.

The forum in our website is the place for our potential users asking questions about health and getting the prioritized answers (most ‘liked’ answer) from other users.  This stack overflow-liked forum does not just stopped at basic Q&A functionality, we also re-invent the way of classifying relevant ‘posts/replies’ under a ‘thread’ in order to allow people freely and conveniently to discuss , browser and reply all the posts which maybe relevant or irrelevant under the ‘main thread’ without interrupting the Q&A functionality of forum.

A forum is the place for people freely exchanging their ideas and expressing their thoughts, but most website’s forum limited our ‘right of speaking’. A Q&A based forum like stack overflow simply close down the ‘thread’ which is not ‘directly related’ to programming, for example it shuts down a ‘thread’ of asking which programming tool is preferred by other users.  Stack overflow seemed does not know the meaning of ‘relevance’. As the fans of ‘butterfly effects’ we all think everything is kind of related to each other, one or two persons cannot make decision to close down a thread.

In contradictory our health forum will not make the same mistake of stack overflow, because we all have a deep understanding of the meaning of health and forum

Health is a word with many hidden meanings, which most people do not realize. In simple word, ‘health’ is a description of good human mental and physical states. ‘What clothes you wear today’ may make you healthier or un-healthier,  if your clothes makes your looked charming then you will be happier/healthier by other people’s admiration. However most people will not consider this kind of situation is related to your ‘health’ .  Therefore as a ‘health forum’ we will not limited our user’s right of creating any kinds of ‘question threads’, only our users can decide and vote to close down a ‘question thread’ which may make most of people feel un-healthier (i.e. unhappy) or think it is totally off-topic about health.  In ‘health overflow’ (our website name), the right of ‘speaking’ is control by the majority of users but not the dictators.

The other major core of our website is ‘online health manager’ which will analyze all user’s health data in a visualization/animation form  (who want to read boring excel data? ). According to user’s health data input, we will give user suggestions or warnings in order to improve their current health state. Data visualization is really a straightforward and interesting way to understand about they own health, the traditional text formed analysis will only make people fall into sleep.

As people’s life standard gets higher, most of them start to concentrate on their health, this trend is why there are many heath wearable devices like Fitbit, Jawbone and Apple Watch are getting more and more popular nowadays.  This is the best time for information technology to re-invent the way of people visualizing, maintaining, and improving their health state. This is also the best time for us to make a website which is more concentrate on people’s health needs, as there are not many health website which actually dominate web application area. Our forum and online health manager will be successful by providing great platform for user to know what they want to know about health, to exchange their fabulous idea of keep healthy , to keep close in touch of their own health statistic and to get advise of making their life more healthier. The potential users of our web application will be large and loyalty, as the topic of health is related to everybody everyday and Health Overflow is a web application, which means it, can be used in any major platform in anywhere. Health Overflow is absolutely a great website which can be fully integrated to people’s everyday life, a great website which has large and loyal potential users and a great website which can be successfully but haven’t not been built yet.
