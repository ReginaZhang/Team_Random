The world is facing a crisis: obesity rates are skyrocketing, more people are dying of preventable "lifestyle diseases" than ever before, and the next generation may well be the first in the past two centuries with a lower life expectancy than its parents (http://unisalzburg.at/fileadmin/multimedia/Universitaet%2055-PLUS/documents/life_expectancy_Olshanksy_2005.pdf). Through careful consideration, we have devised a plan to combat this, through the founding of an innovative health and fitness centred online community.

This community will revolutionise health management by integrating an online diet and fitness tracking system with a Stack Overflow style Q&A forum. Users will be able to upvote the answers most relevant to them, facilitating the accumulation of a wealth of nutrition and exercise knowledge. This community store of knowledge could prove particularly useful to diadvantaged and marginalised communities, allowing them to share in the health-minded community wisdom that is unavailable in their local neighbourhoods.

To further enhance the development of this online community, the site will allow tagging of comments and let users dynamically create filters to customise their experience, ensuring them easy access to the content most relevant to their individual needs. Our revolutionary comment system will also go above and beyond the Stack Overflow model, providing a simple means for users to freely and conveniently discuss, browse and reply to posts which explore issues tangent to the main topic of the thread without derailing or distracting from the topic's Q&A.

A forum should be a place for people to freely express and exchange their ideas, knowledge and experience. Many popular forums unfortunately fail at this, such as Stack Overflow, which closes threads not directly related to the forum topic even when user votes suggest that the thread is relevant to many. This authoritarianism promotes feelings of resentment and isolation in users, underlying the allegedly democratic premise of the voting system. Our revolutionary system transcends this issue entirely, with users having full control over the comments they see via the tag filtering system, allowing different threads of meaning to coexist harmoniously. Health is a word with a rich tapestry of meanings across different groups and cultures, and we will not limit users' ability to explore and discuss the topic in whatever sense is most meaningful to them.

Aside from the forum, our site will also provide an "online health manager". Users will be able to input their health and exercise data, at whatever degree of granularity they're most comfortable with, and the system will store and analysis this data, providing suggestions based on the information they've provided. Suggestions and statistics will be presented in a visual form (who wants to read boring spreadsheets?), but JSON APIs will also be provided so that technically-minded users can explore the data at the level of detail they desire.

Driven by modern HTML technology, our site will allow mobile users to directly scan food items into our system through their barcodes. This will allow users not only to track their dietary history but also receive realtime recommendations on how well particular products suit their current diet, making sticking to a healthy diet a breeze.

With growing health-awareness amongst the population, a site like ours is desperately needed, to not only consolidate health knowledge but also develop a lasting, healthminded online community accessible to anyone no matter their background. The growth of wearables like Fitbit, Jawbone and Apple Watch is opening up incredibly opportunities in automated health management, and our website will be the knot that ties community and technology together, bridging the knowledge gap and empowering users to take their health into their own hands. Together with our users, we aim to halt the progress of preventable lifestyle illnesses dead in its tracks.
