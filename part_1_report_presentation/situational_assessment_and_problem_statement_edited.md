#Situational Assessment and Problem Statement
##Zhanhuai  Huang

Preventable diet and exercise-related illnesses are exacting a greater toll on humanity than ever before, with preventable illnesses like obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease running rife. In America, for instance, it has been predicted that such afflictions will actualy make the next generation die at a younger age than its parents!<http://unisalzburg.at/fileadmin/multimedia/Universitaet%2055-PLUS/documents/life_expectancy_Olshanksy_2005.pdf> Health and fitness is hence a topic of significant and growing concern to almost everyone, as evidenced by the flood of websites that present themselves when a user searches for a health-related topic. Obesity however is still on the rise, which invites the question: are these website actually particularly effective at improving the health and fitness outcomes of the general population, people simply wishing to maintain their weight and fitness at a healthy level without commiting their lives to fitness?

Currently, websites that focus on health-related topics generally fall into one of three categories. Firstly, there are websites dedicated to serious fitness, such as <http://www.muscleandfitness.com/>. These websites are not suitable for the population that simply wishes to remain generally healthy through proper diet and moderate levels of exercise, as they focus on achieving extremely high degrees of fitness that are not needed or desired by the average person. Secondly, there are sites that provide information about nutrition or general health/fitness, like <http://www.healthywomen.org/>, and thirdly there are websites that provide forums for health discussion, such as <https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/66048/health>, which is currently under development, and <http://fitness.stackexchange.com/>. These sites are however limited in their scope, failing to provide users with interactive services for assisting them with their daily health decisions, and hence not engaging users sufficiently to bring about effective health improvements. There is hence need for a dynamic, interactive online community that harnesses the power of technology to drastically simplify diet and fitness management.

The core problem is actually not unique to health-related websites. Generally, websites focused on niche topics like hardcore fitness are easier to design due to their limited scope; it is more difficult to build succesful general purpose sites, particularly ones capable of engaging a significant enough proportion of the population to bring about widespread change in behaviour. There is neverthless significant potential due to rising awareness of diet and fitness issues: ABS statistics for instance show that over 2.3 million (under-estimated figure) Australians were on a diet in 2011-12 (<http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4364.0.55.007main+features12011-12>), 14% of the population participate in gymnasiums and 23% walk for exercise (<http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Products/4156.0.55.001~Nov+2011~Main+Features~Physical+Recreation?OpenDocument>). Wearable devices and applications dealing with health and fitness management are also rising in popularity, such as (<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep>, Apple HealthKit)/smart-devices (<http://www.amazon.com/giftsbox-Original-Bracelet-Waterproof-Wristband/dp/B00PW8IBSS>), applications that gather information about people's heart rate, pace, walking distance or even sleeping status to monitor the users' conditions about general exercise/fitness. These applications are however limited in functionality compared to our proposal, and any attempts they make at community-building are stunded by the commercial desires of the organisations behind them to build "walled gardens" around their products so as to lock uers in.

Our stakeholders include netizens concerned about their health and wishing to harness the power of technology, like the poster of <https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-Q-A-website-like-Stack-Overflow-for-health> and the many people who post health questions on Yahoo Answers. This is not all, however: ultimately the whole of society has a stake in it, as the health problems we seek to tackle are a society-wide problem, and our site could potentially be of benefit to anyone who either faces or knows people who face preventable health issues. Governments are a stakeholder, in that our site could enhance the effectiveness of their health campaigns, especially if they work with us. Dieticians and medical professionals also have a stake in
the site's outcomes, as it could be used to assist in patient management, and to allow these professionals to get their message out to a wider audience. Producers of health-enhancing products and services are also potential stakeholders, in that our site could serve as a platform for them to more easily reach potential benificiaries of their products. Even people who are already quite fit will benefit, as if our site increases overall societal healthiness then these people won't have so much of their income spent on subsidising the unfit, as the amount of their taxes spent on providing treatment for preventable illnesses in the unfit will be reduced, due to there being fewer unfit people.

Less directly, users of potential competitors such as Stack Exchange also benefit. Stack Exchange's moderation policies have of late grown more and more draconian, driving away users and building resentment in the community (http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2c59xe/what_i_learned_from_answering_questions_for_30/) (http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2w6unq/my_lovehate_relationship_with_stack_overflow/). Our approach, which avoids the need for harsh moderation through our revolutionary content filtering system that puts power back in the hands of the users, will show that there is an alternative to strict, undemocratic moderation models, providing an avenue of change down which users can force sites that engage in such undesirable moderation.

Our site has the potential to benefit all the above stakeholders: improving population health, reducing the health burden on governments, allowing organisations and health professionals to better reach users with their advice and products, and improving the internet ecosystem through pioneering a new community model. An effort like this is desperately needed, as if population health continues at its current trajectory then peoples' quality of life will only get worse and worse.
