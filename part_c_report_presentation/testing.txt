Testing

For the user interface testing, we will run a small program and test automatically
at a regular time to make sure all essential elements are presented and visible to 
the users and that all links are functioning. This will be done using Python libs
called Selenium and Unittest. The first one is a library specially for web browsing
and testing. The program would be able to "see" the pages, "move" the mice and "click"
on the buttons just like it was a human. The second module is a built-in library of
Python for running tests units and output the basic report to standard-out. For instance,
whether the particular test case has failed or succeeded and, if failed, what are the
error messages (predefined by the programmer or in the default way).

We would also be using our forum as a place to discuss our project, so that we could
test our forum and database functionalities as well as experience our forum from the
signed-up users' view in a fun and proud way.
