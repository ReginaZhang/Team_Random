Our project uses a microservices approach, with different services responsible for different parts of the site's functionality. The modules folder contains these services. modules/getFoodSuggestion/ contains the Java code responsible for handling user registration and login, and the management of users' diets. modules/food_api contains the Python code responsible for getting food nutrition information from the US gov nutrition api, storing it in the local database and caching it. modules/forum contains the Clojure and Clojurescript code for the forum backend and frontend respectively, as well as the backend code for giving food suggestions...
